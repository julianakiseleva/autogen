Multiplying both sides of the congruence by $a$ yields that $a^2 \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{24}$, or equivalently that $a^2 - 1 \\\\equiv (a+1)(a-1) \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{24}$. Since $a$ is not divisible by $3$, it follows that at least one of $a+1$ or $a-1$ must be divisible by $3$. Also, since $a$ is not divisible by $2$, then both $a+1$ and $a-1$ are even, and exactly one of them is divisible by $4$. Thus, $3 \\\\times 2 \\\\times 4 = 24$ will always divide into $(a+1)(a-1)$, and so the statement is true for every integer $a$ relatively prime to $24$. The answer is the set of numbers relatively prime to $24$, namely $\\\\{1,5,7,11,13,17,19,23\\\\}$.

This can happen in one of the two ways:\\n\\n1. Choose 4 green peppers and 2 red peppers\\n2. Choose 5 green peppers and 1 red pepper\\n\\nFor the first scenario, we can find the combinations of selecting 4 green peppers from 5 available green peppers and 2 red peppers from 10 available red peppers. Similarly, for the second scenario, we can find the combinations of selecting 5 green peppers from 5 available green peppers and 1 red pepper from 10 available red peppers.\\n\\nFinally, we can calculate the probability by dividing the sum of the combinations from both scenarios by the total combinations of selecting 6 peppers. \\n\\nI will now calculate the probability using code.\",\n",

The constraint $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\\\le 25$ is the equation of a solid sphere with radius 5 since, for any point (x, y, z) within this boundary, its Euclidean distance from the origin must be less than or equal to 5.\\n\\n2.

The constraint $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\\\le 25$ is the equation of a solid sphere with radius 5 since, for any point (x, y, z) within this boundary, its Euclidean distance from the origin must be less than or equal to 5.\\n\\n2. The constraint $z \\\\ge 0$ restricts the allowed region to be only the \\\"upper\\\" half of the sphere. It keeps only those points where the $z$-coordinate is non-negative.\\n\\nNow that we understand the region $S$ is the upper half of a sphere with radius 5, we can analyze the geometric properties of this region to find the largest cube we can fit inside it.\\n\\nTo visualize the process, let's imagine we place the cube with one of its vertices at the origin, and the rest of the cube extends in the first octant (positive $x, y, z$ region). We can then scale this cube up or down while keeping it within $S$.\\n\\nWe can find the largest cube by considering the plane formed by the intersection of $S$ and the surface of the cube that is at the maximum distance from the origin.\\n\\nLet's consider the three vertices of the cube that lie on this surface. Let these vertices' coordinates be $(a, 0, 0)$, $(0, a, 0)$, and $(0, 0, a)$, where $a$ is the side length of the cube we are trying to find.\\n\\nSince these vertices lie on the surface of $S$, they must satisfy the two given constraints. The most restrictive of these constraints will be $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\\\le 25$.\\n\\nLet's plug in the coordinates of these vertices into the inequality.\\n\\nFor $(a, 0, 0)$: $a^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 \\\\le 25$\\nFor $(0, a, 0)$: $0^2 + a^2 + 0^2 \\\\le 25$\\nFor $(0, 0, a)$: $0^2 + 0^2 + a^2 \\\\le 25$\\n\\nAll three of these conditions give the same inequality $a^2 \\\\le 25$. Thus, the maximum value of $a$ is $\\\\sqrt{25} = 5$, and the side length of the largest cube that can fit inside $S$ is $5$.\\n\\nThis makes sense intuitively since if we were to take a vertical cross-section of this hemisphere and maximize the dimensions of a square contained within a semicircle, the optimal square's side length would be equal to the radius of the semicircle.\\n\\nSo the side length of the largest cube contained in $S$ is 5.\",\n",

Now, we will eliminate $t$ from the equation by expressing $\\\\cos t$ in terms of $x$, and then substitute this expression back into the equation for $y$.\\n\\n$\\\\cos^2 t = 1 - \\\\sin^2 t = 1 - x^2$\\n\\nSolve for $\\\\cos t$:\\n$\\\\cos t = \\\\sqrt{1 - x^2}$\\n\\nNow substitute back into the equation for $y$:\\n$y = 2x\\\\cos t = 2x\\\\sqrt{1 - x^2}$\\n\\nNow, square both sides to eliminate the square root:\\n$y^2 = 4x^2(1 - x^2)$\\n\\nRearrange the equation to match the form $ax^4 - bx^2 + cy^2 = 0$:\\n$4x^4 - 4x^2 + y^2 = 0$\\n\\nThis equation is already in the desired form with $a = 4$, $b = 4$, and $c = 1$. So $a+b+c=4+4+1=9$. Therefore, the smallest possible value of $a+b+c$ is 9.\",\n",
