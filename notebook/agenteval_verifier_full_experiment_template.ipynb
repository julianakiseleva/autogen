In our case, n = 15 (total peppers) and k = 6 (peppers to select).\\n\\nNext, we need to find the number of ways that the cook can choose at least 4 green peppers. This can happen in one of the two ways:\\n\\n1. Choose 4 green peppers and 2 red peppers\\n2. Choose 5 green peppers and 1 red pepper\\n\\nFor the first scenario, we can find the combinations of selecting 4 green peppers from 5 available green peppers and 2 red peppers from 10 available red peppers. Similarly, for the second scenario, we can find the combinations of selecting 5 green peppers from 5 available green peppers and 1 red pepper from 10 available red peppers.\\n\\nFinally, we can calculate the probability by dividing the sum of the combinations from both scenarios by the total combinations of selecting 6 peppers. \\n\\nI will now calculate the probability using code.\",\n",
