return evaluation_criteria
```

Each criterion is narrowly defined to assess a specific part of the task execution or the outcome, ensuring that they are distinguishable, quantifiable, and not redundant. The "accepted_values" provide a multi-graded level of responses for each criterion to facilitate fine-grained evaluation.

(Note: Since the task involves a real-world and complex calculation, not all criteria may be applicable to every step of the solution. However, the above list should cover the major aspects of evaluating the complete end-to-end process.)
