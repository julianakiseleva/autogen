Read the image file '9318445f-fe6a-4e1b-acbf-c68228c9906a.png' from the current working directory.\n2. Use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from the image.\n3. Identify all the fractions and sample problems within the extracted text.\n4. Solve the sample problems if they are mathematical expressions.\n5. Compile a comma-separated list of the fractions and the answers to the sample problems, ordered by their appearance in the image.\n\nSince I am an AI assistant with Python skills, I can provide a Python script to read the image and perform OCR to extract the text. However, I do not have the capability to execute the script myself. I will provide the Python code for the computer_terminal to execute.\n\nHere is the Python code to read the image and perform OCR using the `pytesseract` library, which is a Python wrapper for Google's Tesseract-OCR Engine. Please note that `pytesseract` and its dependencies must be installed on the system where the script is executed.\n\n```python\n# filename: ocr_fractions.py\nimport pytesseract\nfrom PIL import Image\n\n# Ensure that pytesseract is pointing to the Tesseract executable on your system\n# pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'<path_to_your_tesseract_executable>'\n\ndef extract_text(image_path):\n    # Open the image file\n    with Image.open(image_path) as img:\n        # Use pytesseract to do OCR on the image\n        text = pytesseract.image_to_string(img)\n    return text\n\ndef find_fractions_and_problems(text):\n    # This function will need to be implemented to find fractions and solve problems\n    # For now, it just returns the raw text\n    return text\n\n# The path to the image file\nimage_path = '9318445f-fe6a-4e1b-acbf-c68228c9906a.png'\n\n# Extract text from the image\nextracted_text = extract_text(image_path)\n\n# Find fractions and sample problems in the text\nresults = find_fractions_and_problems(extracted_text)\n\n# Print the results\nprint(results)\n```\n\nPlease run this script using the computer_terminal.
